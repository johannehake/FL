For the project: **Education Under Threat? Navigating the Intersection of Informational Autocracy and Russian Education**


**Abstract**

In this thesis, I develop the concept of centralized curriculum control (“CCC”), as a survival strategy employed by informational autocrats. I explore the case of Russian education under President Vladimir Putin’s leadership. In the study, I employ original data from the Putin regime’s list of school textbooks between 2006 and 2020. The findings indicate a less diverse composition of textbook publishing houses, particularly in the fundamentals of life safety (“FLS”) subjects following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, in comparison to non-societal disciplines. The history and social studies subjects experienced less increase than anticipated following the annexation, but market concentration was still higher here than in natural sciences. Further, efforts to instill regime friendly values in societal disciplines substantiate that centralization and educational content is used by the Putin regime to counter regime threats. The study concludes that the Putin regime utilizes CCC, through various tools, to control educational content, which further enables it to infuse regime-friendly values in education, and that this is a strategy of the regime to counter regime threats.
