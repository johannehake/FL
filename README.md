Abstract: This thesis puts forward the concept of informational autocratic indoctrination, indicated by “centralized curriculum control” (“CCC”), as a viable autocratic survival strategy for informational autocrats. The theory is applied to the case of Russian education under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin. The study reveals that there have been efforts at instilling military-patriotic values in the subjects History and Fundamentals of Life Safety (“FLS”). These efforts have been easier to execute by CCC. Through a self-coded data set based on federal lists of textbook recommendations for primary and secondary schools by the Russian government, the study demonstrates that fewer publishing houses from 2006 to 2020 were included. This trend was especially prominent in History and FLS following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The findings suggest that the Putin regime pursues CCC as a strategy in the education system to promote regime-friendly values and justify their actions, especially under pressure.
